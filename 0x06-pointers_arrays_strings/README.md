# This project contains more on Pointers, arrays and strings

## 0x06. C â€“ More Pointers, arrays and strings

## Learning Objective:

* What are pointers and how to use them

* What are arrays and how to use them

* What are the differences between pointers and arrays

* How to use strings and how to manipulate them

* Scope of variables

### A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value. A pointer variable points to a data type (like int) of the same type, and is `created with the * operator`.

### An array is a data structure, which can store a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type.

 - File: `main.h` is the header file containing all the function prototypes used in this project.

 - File: `0-strcat.c` is a function that concatenates two strings
