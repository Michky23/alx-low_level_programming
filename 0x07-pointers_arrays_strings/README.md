# This Project contains in detail more of pointers, arrays and strings

## 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

## Learning Objectives:

- What are pointers to pointers and how to use them

- What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them

- What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings

### A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value. A pointer variable points to a data type (like int) of the same type, and is created with the * operator.

### An array is a data structure, which can store a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type.

### A string is a sequence of characters terminated with a null character \0

- File: `main.h` is the header file containing all the function prototypes used in the project.

- File: `0-memset.c` is a function that fills memory with a constant byte.

- File: `1-memcpy.c` is a function that copies memory area.

- File: `2-strchr.c` is a function that locates a character in a string.

- File: `3-strspn.c` is a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.

- File: `4-strpbrk.c` is a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.

- File: `5-strstr.c` is a function that locates a substring.

- File: `7-print_chessboard.c` is a function that prints the chessboard.

- File: `8-print_diagsums.c` is a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

- File: `100-set_string.c` is a function that set the value of a pointer to a character.
