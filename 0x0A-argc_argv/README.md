# This project contains the basic command line of argument count(argc) and argument vector(argv).

## 0x0A. C - argc, argv

## Learning Objectives:

- How to use arguments passed to your program

- What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other

- How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

### The “argc” stands for argument count and it is used to store the non-negative integer type argument including the program name.

###  argv (argument vector), is an array of pointers to arrays of character objects.

- File: `0-whatsmyname.c` is a program that prints its name.

- File: `1-args.c` is a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.

- File: `2-args.c` is a program that prints all arguments it receives.

- File: `3-mul.c` is a program that multiplies two numbers.

- File: `4-add.c` is a program that adds positive numbers.

- File: `100-change.c` is a program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money.
