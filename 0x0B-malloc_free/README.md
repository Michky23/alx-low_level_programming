# This project details about malloc (memory allocation), dynamic allocation, calloc, realloc and free.

## 0x0B. C - malloc, free

## Learning Objectives:

- What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation

- What is malloc and free and how to use them

- Why and when use malloc

- How to use valgrind to check for memory leak

### The malloc() function stands for memory allocation, that allocate a block of memory dynamically. It reserves the memory space for a specified size and returns the null pointer, which points to the memory location.

### Dynamic memory allocation is the process of assigning the memory space during the execution time or the run time.

## The free() function in C is used to free or deallocate the dynamically allocated memory and helps in reducing memory wastage.

- File: `0-create_array.c` is a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.

- File: `1-strdup.c` is a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

- File: `2-str_concat.c` is a function that concatenates two strings.

- File: `3-alloc_grid.c` is a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

- File: `4-free_grid.c` is a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.

- File: `100-argstostr.c` is a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.

- File: `101-strtow.c` is a function that splits a string into words.

- File: `main.h` is the header file containing all the function prototypes used in this project.

- File: `_putchar.c` contains the _ putchar() function definition.
