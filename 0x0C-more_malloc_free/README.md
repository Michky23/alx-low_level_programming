# This project contains details about malloc, free, dynamic memory allocation, exit, calloc and  realloc

## 0x0C. C - More malloc, free

## Learning Objectives:

- How to use the exit function.

- What are the functions calloc and realloc from the standard library and how to use them.

### The malloc() function stands for memory allocation, that allocate a block of memory dynamically. It reserves the memory space for a specified size and returns the null pointer, which points to the memory location.

### Dynamic memory allocation is the process of assigning the memory space during the execution time or the run time.

### The free() function in C is used to free or deallocate the dynamically allocated memory and helps in reducing memory wastage.

### Calloc or “Contiguous allocation” method in C is used to dynamically allocate the specified number of blocks of memory of the specified type.

### Realloc or “re-allocation” method in C is used to dynamically change the memory allocation of a previously allocated memory.

### The exit function in c is defined under the stdlib. h header file is used to terminate the function currently running.

## Definitions and Execises:
