# The project contains basic command on Structur and typedef.

## 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef

## Learning Objectives:

- What are structures, when, why and how to use them

- How to use typedef

### A Structures (also called structs) are a way to group several related variables into one place. Each variable in the structure is known as a member of the structure.

### The C typedef keyword is used to redefine the name of already existing data types. When names of datatypes become difficult to use in programs, typedef is used with user-defined datatypes, which behave similarly to defining an alias for commands.

## Definitions and Exercise:

- File: `dog.h` It Define a new type struct dog and contains the dog.h functions prototype.

- File: `1-init_dog.c` is a function that initialize a variable of type struct dog.

- File: `2-print_dog.c` is a function that prints a struct dog.

- File: `dog.h` It Define a new type dog_t as a new name for the type struct dog.

- File: `4-new_dog.c` is a function that creates a new dog.

- File: `5-free_dog.c` is a function that frees dogs.
