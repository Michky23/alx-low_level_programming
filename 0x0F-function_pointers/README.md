# This project contain details about functions pointers.

## 0x0F. C - Function pointers

## Learning Objectives:

- What are function pointers and how to use them

- What does a function pointer exactly hold

- Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

### Function pointers in C are variables that can store the memory address of functions and can be used in a program to create a function call to functions pointed by them.

## Definitions and Exercise:

- File: `0-print_name.c` is a function that prints a name.

- File: `1-array_iterator.c` is  a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

- File: `2-int_index.c` is a function that searches for an integer.

- File: `3-main.c` is a file/program that contain main function only.

- File: `3-op_functions.c` is a file/program that contain 5 functions, op_add, op_sub, op_mul, op_div, and op_mod.

- File: `3-get_op_func.c` is a file/program that contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user.

- File: `3-calc.h` is a file that contain all the function prototypes and data structures used by the program.

- File: `100-main_opcodes.c` is a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.

- File: `function_pointers.h` is the header file cointaining the prototype function used in this project.

- File: `_putchar.c` contains the _ putchar() function definition.
