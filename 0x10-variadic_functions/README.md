# This project contains the basic command on Variadic Functions

## 0x10. C - Variadic functions

## Learning Objectives:

- What are variadic functions

- How to use va_start, va_arg and va_end macros

- Why and how to use the const type qualifier

### Variadic functions are functions that can take a variable number of arguments. In C programming, a variadic function adds flexibility to the program. It takes one fixed argument and then any number of arguments can be passed.

## Definitions and Exercise:

- File: `0-sum_them_all.c` is a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.

- File: `1-print_numbers.c` is a function that prints numbers.

- File: `2-print_strings.c` is a function that prints strings.

- File: `3-print_all.c` is a function that prints anything.

- File: `_putchar.c` contains the _ putchar() function definition.

- File: `variadic_functions.h` is the (macro functions)header file cointaining the prototype function used in this project.
