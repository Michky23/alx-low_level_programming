# This Project explains the basic terms related to data structure and focus on Singly linked lists.

## 0x12. C - Singly linked lists

## Learning Objectives:

- When and why using linked lists vs arrays

- How to build and use linked lists

### A Singly linked list is a collection of data called nodes, where each node is divided into two parts to store data and address at some random addresses. The pointer next, points to the address of the next node in a list.

## Definitions and Exercise:

- File: `0-print_list.c` is a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.

- File: `1-list_len.c` is a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.

- File: `2-add_node.c` is a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.

- File: `3-add_node_end.c` is  a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.

- File: `4-free_list.c` is a function that frees a list_t list.

- File: `100-first.c` is  a function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.

- File: `101-hello_holberton.asm` is a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton.

- File: `_putchar.c` contains the _ putchar() function definition.

- File: `lists.h` is the header file that contains all the prototypes function used in this project.
