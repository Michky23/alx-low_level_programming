# This project contain Bit manipulation

## 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

## Learning Objectives:

- Look for the right source of information without too much help

- How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

### Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a byte.

## Definitions and Exercise:

- File: `0-binary_to_uint.c` is a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

- File: `1-print_binary.c` is a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

- File: `2-get_bit.c` is a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

- File: `3-set_bit.c` is a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

- File: `4-clear_bit.c` is a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

- File: `5-flip_bits.c` is a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

- File: `100-get_endianness.c` is a function that checks the endianness.

- File: `101-password` To find the password.

- File: `_putchar.c` contains the _ putchar() functions.

- File: `main.h` contains all the prototype functions used during this project.
