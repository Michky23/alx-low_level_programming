# This project contains info and commands of Doubly linked lists

## 0x17. C - Doubly linked lists

## Learning Objectives:

- What is a doubly linked list

- How to use doubly linked lists

- Understand and know how to implement the various operations (deletion, insertion, etc) with doubly linked lists

- Start to look for the right source of information without too much help

## Definitions:

### A doubly linked list (DLL) is a special type of linked list in which each node contains a pointer to the previous node as well as the next node of the linked list. What is a doubly linked list


### A Doubly linked list is a bidirectional linked list; i.e., you can traverse it from head to tail node or tail to head node. Unlike singly-linked lists, its node has an extra pointer that points at the last node
